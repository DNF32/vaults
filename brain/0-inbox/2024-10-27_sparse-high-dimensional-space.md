# curse of dimensionality

Based on the idea that on high dimensional spaces ``randomly" spaced vector are almost orthogonal, we can further explore this as a manifestaion of the curse of dimensionality.

For a tecnical lecture see [Lecture 3](https://rajeshjayaram.com/lectures/lec3.pdf). The material comes from the book in the URL. Futhermore, [Algorithmic Machine Learning and Data Science: CS-GY 6763](https://rajeshjayaram.com/amlds2022) encompasses this a other related topics
