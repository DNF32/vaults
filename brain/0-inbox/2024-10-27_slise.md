# SLISE

SLISE: Sparse Linear Subset is an algorithm that can be used for robust regression or for model interpretability.

I need to see the details. But the idea is that given an error tolerance we are going to fit a model in the largest possible subset such that the error tolerance is respected.

Repo for the python code: [SLISE github](https://github.com/edahelsinki/pyslise)
