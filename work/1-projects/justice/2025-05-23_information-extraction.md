# information extraction


i will get document i will need to in summarize the text and perform other meta data extraction 

each of this funcitonalitires should be in it's own module/folder


Each judge process will have multiple files, I will need  a full summary of all the case files. But I also would like to have summaries for each of the other documents. I was thinking of using a router pattern for each documnet.
