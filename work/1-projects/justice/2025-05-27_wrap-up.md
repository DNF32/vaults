## How to store the chat log memory

Building a ChatGPT-like chat feature with FastAPI for <1000 users on Google Cloud Platform. Need to establish an efficient, cost-effective storage strategy that allows for future growth.
Key Requirements

     Support <1000 users initially
     Fast response times for chat interactions
     Cost-effective for small scale
     Deployable on Google Cloud Platform
     Clear path for future scaling

Decision

Starting with pure in-memory storage implementation with a clear evolution path:
     Phase 1: Pure in-memory storage
     Phase 2: Memory + Basic persistence backup
     Phase 3: Memory + Redis (when needed)
     Phase 4: Full tiered system (future option)
