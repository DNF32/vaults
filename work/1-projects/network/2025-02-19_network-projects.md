# üì° Learning Networking Step-by-Step: A Structured Plan

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Simple "Echo" Server (Basic Client-Server Communication)**

### **Goal:** Learn how to send and receive messages over a network.

### **Concepts You'll Learn**

- How to set up a **TCP server** that listens for connections.
- How a client connects to the server and exchanges messages.
- Basic socket programming in Python.

### **How It Works**

1. The server waits for clients to connect.
2. When a client sends a message, the server **sends the exact same message back**.
3. This will help you understand **how data flows between two computers**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Basic File Transfer Over a Network**

### **Goal:** Learn how to send files between computers.

### **Concepts You'll Learn**

- Sending and receiving binary data over a network.
- Handling **large files** by sending data in chunks.
- Using TCP sockets for **reliable data transfer**.

### **How It Works**

1. A client sends a file to the server.
2. The server receives the file and saves it.
3. You can expand this later by adding **progress indicators, encryption, or error handling**.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Local Network Scanner**

### **Goal:** Learn how to find other devices on your local network.

### **Concepts You'll Learn**

- How **IP addresses and subnets** work.
- Using Python‚Äôs `socket` and `scapy` (optional) to **scan** a network.
- Checking which **ports** are open on detected devices.

### **How It Works**

1. The script scans your network for **active devices**.
2. It can try to **identify open ports** (e.g., is port 80 open for a web server?).
3. This teaches you how devices on a LAN communicate.
