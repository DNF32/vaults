# Preparation

## Basis the Star Method

Situation - Background on the situation
Task - The problem that needed to be addressed
Action - My direct contribution to this. Highlight what the team decided to invest time in, and what's the deliverable.
Results - Stating the outcome of the situation, for instance performance metrics.

## Story's to highlight the Mollie principals

## **Story 1: Expanding Document Support for a New Customer**

**S ‚Äì Situation**
We had a legacy FastAPI application designed to extract information from technical documents. While it functioned, it had multiple bugs and a growing backlog. Its main strength was adaptability‚Äîit could be customized to different engineering teams' needs.

**T ‚Äì Task**
A new customer requested support for a specific type of document that the system wasn‚Äôt originally designed to handle. I was tasked with implementing this new capability.

**A ‚Äì Action**
I analyzed the structure of the new document type and implemented a new extraction pipeline within the platform, extending its modularity. I also had to navigate a complex, poorly structured codebase to make the changes.

**R ‚Äì Result**
The system could now extract information from this new document type, opening the door for broader customer adoption. It also demonstrated the platform‚Äôs flexibility in supporting multiple use cases with minimal disruption.

üìå **Mollie Principles Highlighted:**

- **Make our customers proud** ‚Äì delivered value to a new user by adapting the platform
- **Get things done today** ‚Äì delivered a working feature despite technical debt
- **Bold ownership** ‚Äì navigated and contributed to unfamiliar, unstructured code

---

## **Story 2: Taking Ownership and Refactoring the Legacy System**

**S ‚Äì Situation**
While working on that feature, I realized the system‚Äôs architecture was overly monolithic‚Äîmany files were \~2,000 lines long, duplicated logic was everywhere, and no one in the team fully understood the codebase.

**T ‚Äì Task**
I decided to take ownership and lead a major refactor to modularize and clean up the codebase to support long-term maintainability.

**A ‚Äì Action**
I invested some of my own time learning best practices for structuring FastAPI applications. I built a proof of concept with a cleaner, more modular architecture and presented it to my technical supervisor. Once approved, I spent my remaining allocation time restructuring the service to follow better practices and eliminate redundancy.

**R ‚Äì Result**
The refactored codebase is now easier to maintain, test, and extend. New features can be added with less risk of breaking existing functionality, and team members can onboard faster.

üìå **Mollie Principles Highlighted:**

- **Bold ownership, humble execution** ‚Äì took initiative on a neglected codebase
- **Embrace change** ‚Äì redesigned a legacy system in a way that supports adaptability
- **Speak up** ‚Äì proactively proposed a technical direction and got stakeholder buy-in

## Why mollie?

What draws me to Mollie is the combination of a real engineering-driven fintech culture, structured in-office collaboration, and strong technical peer engagement. In my current consulting-like role, I don‚Äôt have consistent code review routines or shared office time, which I find valuable for real growth. At Mollie, I‚Äôll be supported by smart colleagues, get daily feedback in meaningful code reviews, and develop deep domain expertise in scalable payment systems. That‚Äôs exactly the environment I want to build my career in.

# Turning the tables, question for interviewing

- How is AI usage seen in the company/team culture
  R: Before getting the answer of the hiring manager I want to tell how I use it. I mostrly use neovim, so I don't really have a full AI intregration on my workflow. I buy some API credits and use chat models to get quick answer for small doubt or code snippeed. I feel that my happiness coding is inversely proportial to the amount of "vibe coding".

- I've see that in the listed the stack listed is java and php, can I also be placed in a team/unit with other langs, for instance on jvm like scala or even Go? (I think I saw a listing for Platform engeneering for Go)

- Past experience with the gradute program, what's the expected timeline of improvement
  What would you say that is the general grown trajectory of gradutes during this program.

- Feedback culture, is there some kind of onboaring section that teaches us how to give feedback align with mollie.
  How is the feedback culture strutureeed, during the onboaring is there some form of trainning, of a guide. Specially in the graduate program, is there periodic feedback check during the gradute journey.

# Possible questions

## Why mollie?

In fintech, what's at stake is people's trust and livelihoods, which attracts detail-oriented, rigorous teams‚Äîexactly the environment I want to be part of. At Mollie, I'll get the engineering-driven culture, consistent code reviews, and in-office collaboration that my current consulting role lacks, while developing deep expertise in scalable payment systems that people depend on every day.

## Why work at mollie?

I don‚Äôt know anyone at Mollie personally, so I can only get a sense of the day-to-day from what‚Äôs visible externally‚Äîbut I strongly relate to several of your values. For example, ‚ÄúMake our customers proud‚Äù resonates deeply with me. It reflects a commitment to building long-lived products with real impact for real users, rather than short-term automation. I also value ‚ÄúGet things done today‚Äù, which suggests a culture where people take initiative and ideas can emerge bottom-up‚Äînot just from leadership, but from everyone involved, especially during ideation.

I‚Äôve really enjoyed the onboarding process so far. From the recruiting side, the communication and feedback have been excellent. During my technical interview with Jo√£o and Sonya, they were incredibly supportive and shared useful hints throughout the conversation, which left a very positive impression of the team‚Äôs collaborative spirit.
