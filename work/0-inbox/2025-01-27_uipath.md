# uipath
Studio is the IDE where we can set the configuration of the document extractors and the classifier. 


-- if a task has a conf level below a set threshold then we it is sent to the user
-- there are tools for labeling; we can get more data through human feedback


-- they sell the UIpath ocr as being really good, it can also detect handwritting EN, DE, FR



----------
Stages of document understanding 
digitization - parse the PDF of apply OCR
classification of the document - this can be done with ML models or keyword models
extraction - 
  - Forms extractor, it seems like the IDA solution (it requirers trainning). It needs a fixed struture.
  - Forms AI, it seems the same but without the trainning req
  - Semi-strutured AI, it seems the most flexible solution. It is the one that can take a now fixe struture.


For pretrained models they highligh two:
  - One for invoices
  - One for receipts 



Error detections can be made with business rules 
  - quantity multipled by the unit price  must equal the line amount 
  - net amount plus tax amount must equal total amount.
  




----------
Taxonomy manager

Create and configure the document types. We can also define the business logic for error management.

There is a validation station
