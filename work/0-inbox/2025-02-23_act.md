# Client Requirements vs. Current Capabilities

This document outlines the client's requirements for the **AI-supported tool for digitizing wiring schematics** and compares them with the current capabilities of our solution.

---

## **Client Requirements**

The client wants a tool that can:

1. **Digitize analog wiring schematics** (photos/scans) into a digital format compatible with **Eplan**.
2. **Recognize and extract specific components** such as:
   - Fuses (e.g., `F1`, `F101`)
   - Contactors (e.g., `Q1`, `Q10`, `Q20`)
   - Clamps (e.g., `X191`)
3. **Extract identifiers**:
   - Plant identifier
   - Location code
   - Equipment identifier (usually found in the frame data of the page).
4. **Extract specifications**:
   - Nominal current (e.g., `10A` for `F10`)
   - Other equipment-specific details.
5. **Handle poor-quality schematics**:
   - Dirty, blurred, or handwritten additions.
6. **Mark unrecognized elements**:
   - Unrecognized elements should be marked with an empty red box for manual correction.
7. **Support partial solutions**:
   - The client is open to partial solutions if full automation is not immediately achievable.

## **Current Capabilities**

Based on the examples provided, we can currently:

### **1. Extract Component Labels**

- We can recognize and extract component labels such as:
  - **Fuses**: `F1`, `F101`
  - **Contactors**: `Q1`, `Q10`, `Q20`
  - **Clamps**: `X191`
    - Inside those we have sublist that we can also detect: `X191:9'`
- These labels are extracted accurately from the schematics and use the fact that they start with `-`

### **2. Mark Unrecognized Elements**

- Unrecognized elements that manualy be added.

### **3. Partial Extraction of Identifiers**

- We can extract some **identifiers** (e.g., plant identifier, location code, equipment identifier) from the frame data, depending on the clarity of the text.

---

## **Limitations**

### **1. Extraction of Descriptions and Specifications**

- We **cannot yet extract detailed descriptions** such as:

  - **Nominal current** (e.g., `10A` for `F10`)
  - Other equipment-specific details (e.g., `WG1`).

- To achieve this, we could employ a centroid based apporach where we employ a specific regex patter for a desired feature. For example, we would first search for the tags, and then, based on the results found, we would use the bounding box (bbox) to try to locate the appropriate information."

### **2. Handling Poor-Quality Schematics**

- We didn't try with the images because the results won't be good. This kind of solution needs good data.

## **Next Steps**

1. **Deliver Partial Solution**:

   - We will deliver the current functionality, which includes extracting component labels and marking unrecognized elements.
   - Unrecognized elements (e.g., nominal current, other specifics) will be marked for manual input.

2. **Future Improvements**:
   - We will work on improving the tool's ability to extract detailed descriptions (e.g., nominal current) and handle poor-quality schematics more effectively.
   - Updates will be provided as these capabilities are developed.

---

## **Conclusion**

We can currently deliver a **partial solution** that meets some of the client's requirements, with a focus on extracting component labels and marking unrecognized elements for manual correction. Future updates will address the extraction of detailed descriptions and improved handling of poor-quality schematics.
