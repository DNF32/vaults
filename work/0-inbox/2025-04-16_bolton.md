# Bolton

Planograma das shelves - done by the retailer to ensure the shelve space contract is being done

Assumindo que o shelve space is being done - we can track some metrics with the cameras

---

# Proposel

The proposel will be a remote workshop retail

# Session

We can't really do real solution since we are dependent on the cameras from the retailer.
Turn the workshop idea of bolton into a "show our product".

# AI agents

- Add an emphasis on the cost small business case
- A bit less of details at the end.
- More examples
  - More focus on the Social healthcare
  - More focus on the cost and error checking on the business case
  - IBM - Oncology check this case

AI agents in healthcare are transforming the field by assisting with everything from diagnosis to patient care management. Here's a breakdown of how AI agents are being used in health:
üß† 1. Clinical Decision Support
AI agents help doctors make better decisions by analyzing data like:
Patient history
Lab results
Imaging (X-rays, MRIs, etc.)
Examples:
IBM Watson for Oncology suggests cancer treatments.
Google DeepMind‚Äôs AI can detect over 50 eye diseases from retinal scans.
üè• 2. Virtual Health Assistants
These AI-powered agents interact with patients via chat or voice to:
Schedule appointments
Remind patients to take meds
Answer health-related questions
Examples:
Babylon Health
Ada Health
Microsoft Health Bot
üß™ 3. Drug Discovery & Development
AI accelerates the process by:
Predicting how molecules will behave
Identifying potential drug candidates
Designing clinical trials
Example:
BenevolentAI and Insilico Medicine use AI to identify promising compounds.
üîç 4. Medical Imaging & Diagnostics
AI can outperform humans in recognizing patterns in scans:
Detecting tumors, fractures, and abnormalities
Radiology, pathology, dermatology applications
Example:
Aidoc and Zebra Medical Vision analyze CT scans and X-rays.
üíº 5. Administrative Support
AI agents streamline hospital operations:
Automating billing
Managing electronic health records (EHRs)
Transcribing doctor-patient conversations
Example:
Nuance DAX (Dragon Ambient eXperience) automates clinical documentation.
ü§ñ 6. Personalized Medicine
AI uses patient-specific data (genomics, lifestyle, etc.) to tailor treatments:
Custom drug regimens
Predictive models for disease risk
üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è 7. Remote Monitoring & Chronic Disease Management
AI tracks patient data in real time using wearables and IoT devices:
Detecting abnormal readings
Alerting caregivers or initiating interventions
Example:
Livongo for diabetes and hypertension management.
