Motivation for Vinogradov:
Vinogradov’s motivation for bounding the
mean value Js,k(X) was to extract bounds for individual sums fk(α; X), which (as
we will summarize later) would impact many number-theoretic problems, the most
famous relating to Waring’s problem and the Riemann zeta function.  

Explaination for picture of parabola:
The idea is that whilst f may be difficult to analyse, it can be broken up as a sum of pieces fθ which are much easier to understand (in particular, the pieces fθ are localised in frequency to small regions where the submanifold is essentially flat). 

Talk about $\ell^2$ decoupling conjecture, on some of the consequences maybe discrete restriction. In the original paper there are some consequences for diophantine equations, essencially a linear and ^k term of Vinogradov.

Story of Vinogradov:
- Wooley d=3
- BDG for d>3, using only analysis
- Wooley, nested efficient congruencing
- Guo, Zane Li, Po-lam Yung, Pavel Zorin-Kranich


Tom Wolf studies the Wave equation. By proving a certain square function estimate local smoothing would follow, but squared function estimtes are hard, so we can work with a weaker objected. One related to the other by a Minkoski integral inequality.

Need to see why we only study p, q> 2, heuristic idea. (see notes parbola)

Talk about the iteration idea in sub-multiplicity
