# co-innovation-projects

Right how there are two projects that I know of, optima and actemize. I don't know which is which. 

Optima:
One applies computer vision to detect anomalies in wind power station (eolica). The idea is to preventively detect malfunctionso that we can save on mantunance cost. The project is trying to pivot to apply this to electicity postes, Madalena.  

Actemize:
The other is an information extraction project. The client has some kind of plants, and in those he wants to extract tags. The models has to operation modes, OCR (some file may have handwritten annotations) and native pdf text parsing. 
There is an LLM head so that via NL the user can create the regex to feed to the OCR or the parser. I don't know the specifics of the model. 

------
The new project on the horizon. 
Venchi is a luxuary ice cream and chocolate store. 

They differentiate them selves by having a personalized experience. For instance by giving to try multiple samples to the customer. 

They want to track if this `perks` are being served to their customers. 

Two camereras per store to do video recording. Video processing with 24h delay, 1080p 14h. The Azure cost estimate is 400 mouth for 10 stores. 

  - frame rate will be a parameter to see
  - MediaPipe line is a framework that can be used to set up the application. It has different vision models.
