- [ ] Today learn about metrics and try to run MOT17 on the tracker.
- [ ] Group the code so that it becomes more modular and agnostic to detector/tracker
- [ ] The next step would be to connect deepsort to the model


Side note on the SORT:
Some of the preditction might have negative first and second parameter but this can be handled with the computervision metrics. 


Metrics Used and what they mean:
# MOT Challenge Metrics Summary

The **MOT Challenge** provides several metrics to evaluate the performance of multiple object tracking (MOT) algorithms. These metrics focus on detection accuracy, identity consistency, and the overall performance of tracking systems.

## **1. ID Metrics**
### **IDF1 (Identity F1 Score)**
- **Definition**: Measures the accuracy of identity matching between ground truth and predicted tracks.
- **Formula**: 
  \[
  IDF1 = \frac{2 \times IDP \times IDR}{IDP + IDR}
  \]
- **Interpretation**: A higher IDF1 score indicates fewer identity switches and better consistency in tracking.

### **IDP (Identity Precision)**
- **Definition**: Precision of correctly predicted identities out of all predicted identities.
- **Interpretation**: A higher IDP means fewer false positives in terms of identity assignments.

### **IDR (Identity Recall)**
- **Definition**: Recall of correctly predicted identities out of all ground truth identities.
- **Interpretation**: A higher IDR means fewer ground truth objects are missed.

---

## **2. Detection Metrics**
### **Recall**
- **Definition**: The percentage of ground truth objects that were detected by the tracker.
- **Interpretation**: High recall means fewer objects were missed.

### **Precision**
- **Definition**: The percentage of predicted objects that matched a ground truth object.
- **Interpretation**: High precision means fewer false positives in the tracking results.

---

## **3. Object Tracking Status**
### **num_unique_objects**
- **Definition**: The total number of unique ground truth objects (e.g., pedestrians) across all frames.

### **mostly_tracked**
- **Definition**: The number of objects that were tracked for more than 80% of their life span.
- **Interpretation**: A higher number indicates stable tracking.

### **partially_tracked**
- **Definition**: The number of objects that were tracked for 20%-80% of their life span.
- **Interpretation**: A lower number is better, meaning fewer objects were partially tracked.

### **mostly_lost**
- **Definition**: The number of objects that were tracked for less than 20% of their life span.
- **Interpretation**: A higher number suggests poor tracking performance for many objects.

---

## **4. Error Metrics**
### **num_false_positives**
- **Definition**: The number of predictions that did not match any ground truth object.
- **Interpretation**: Fewer false positives are better, as it means the tracker didn't produce irrelevant detections.

### **num_misses**
- **Definition**: The number of ground truth objects that were not detected by the tracker.
- **Interpretation**: Fewer misses indicate a more successful tracker.

### **num_switches**
- **Definition**: The number of times a tracker assigned a different identity to an object.
- **Interpretation**: Fewer switches are better, as it indicates the tracker can maintain identities consistently over time.

### **num_fragmentations**
- **Definition**: The number of times a track was interrupted and resumed as a new track.
- **Interpretation**: Fewer fragmentations indicate stable tracking across long durations.

---

## **5. Tracking Performance Metrics**
### **MOTA (Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy)**
- **Definition**: A combined metric that accounts for false positives, false negatives (misses), and identity switches.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  MOTA = 1 - \frac{FP + FN + ID\_Switches}{GT}
  \]
- **Interpretation**: Ranges from -1 (worst) to 1 (perfect). A higher MOTA indicates better overall tracking performance.

### **MOTP (Multiple Object Tracking Precision)**
- **Definition**: Measures the precision of the predicted bounding boxes compared to ground truth bounding boxes.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  MOTP = \frac{\sum_{i} d_i}{N}
  \]
  where \(d_i\) is the distance (usually Intersection over Union, IoU) between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.
- **Interpretation**: A higher MOTP indicates better localization accuracy for the tracked objects.

---

## **6. Additional Metrics**
### **num_transfer**
- **Definition**: The number of objects that switched between tracks.
- **Interpretation**: Fewer transfers mean better track continuity.

### **num_ascend**
- **Definition**: The number of new tracks that were re-assigned after being lost.
- **Interpretation**: Fewer ascends indicate better long-term tracking.

### **num_migrate**
- **Definition**: The number of objects that migrated to different identities.
- **Interpretation**: Fewer migrations suggest better identity consistency over time.
